# 2026-01-28 - Group Meeting about ideas

We used this time to go into depth to another idea after meeting with a TA today in office hours (yuleis2@illinois.edu). We reviewed the automatic shut-off, ROM detector for physical therapy, and the study space sensor. We deteremined that none of the ideas had enough hardware to make it a solid project.  

**New idea: Back Health Posture Aid**   
**Key Elements:** 
- Elastic bands that correct posture, is not a crutch but a reminder (doesn't just fix your posture but instead encourages you to maintain  
the back muscles)
- Pressure sensors that detect slouching vs. not slouching.

# 2026-02-10 - Proposal Document Draft Meeting + First TA Meeting
**Objectives:**
- Complete first TA meeting: ask for feedback on high-level requirements and block diagram, schedule weekly recurring meetings, and set up form of communication
- Complete first draft of the ethics, safety, and societal impact portion of proposal
- Complete portions of the introduction including high-level requirements and visual aid

We started drafting the first project proposal document that is due on Friday. We wrote up three high-level requirements before the TA meeting. 
We also made a first draft of the block diagram that included details of the subsystem requirements. Things to complete in the group meeting to day include parts of the introduction, and the paragraph about ethics and safety. What I will be completing today is the first draft of the ethics and safety paragraph. Below is my first draft of the block diagram to include in the proposal.

**Block Diagram**

**TA Meeting**
- Scheduled weekly meeting times: 10AM on Mondays
- Made discord group chat for commuincation
- Got feedback on the high-level requirements: need to quantify some of the values stated (e.g. how long it takes to return to the calibrated upright position and how long it takes to release the tension after reaching proper posture)
- Feedback on block diagram: Make a lot more specific, include things like UART vs. SPI, also include how each subsystem interfaces with one another

**Tasks completed**
- TA meeting: meetings scheduled, feedback received
- Ethics section first draft
- Introduction first draft
