# 2026-01-28 - Group Meeting about ideas

We used this time to go into depth to another idea after meeting with a TA today in office hours (yuleis2@illinois.edu). We reviewed the automatic shut-off, ROM detector for physical therapy, and the study space sensor. We deteremined that none of the ideas had enough hardware to make it a solid project.  

**New idea: Back Health Posture Aid**   
**Key Elements:** 
- Elastic bands that correct posture, is not a crutch but a reminder (doesn't just fix your posture but instead encourages you to maintain  
the back muscles)
- Pressure sensors that detect slouching vs. not slouching.
