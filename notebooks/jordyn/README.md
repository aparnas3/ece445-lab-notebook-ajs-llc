**Date:** 1/28/2026

**Meeting Objectives:**
1. Rethink ideas- our original ideas were too simple, and we want something with more hardware.
2. Once we come up with a viable idea, make a new web board post to be reviewed.
3. Create a draft RFA to bring to office hours tomorrow for review.

**Record:**
* We came up with an initial idea for a posture-correcting device that would also have an app. The basic design would consist of the following
  - a tight-fitting wearable vest (athletic material)
  - servo motors* in the back
  - elastic connected to servo motors that will wind up to fix bad posture
  - pressure sensor in front of vest to sense when the person is slouching
 * Some features we are thinking of implementing:
     - it would straighten the person's back with elastics, then release when they are at the correct posture so the person has to work at staying upright by themselves
     -  We would create an app that allows people to actually set paramaters and track their posture records
     -  We would also have a way in the app to set a "brace mode" for back injuries
     -  Stretch goal: maybe a weight sensor to be able to trach how much load you are putting on your shoulders
* Rough sketch:
